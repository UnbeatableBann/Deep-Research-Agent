        "This project focuses on building a **Planning Agent for Deep Research and Structured Report Generation**. The agent automates the process of analyzing a user-defined topic, performing web research, and generating a well-structured report. The workflow includes the following components:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Report Planning**:\n",
        "   - The agent analyzes the user-provided **topic** and **default report template** to create a custom plan for the report.\n",
        "   - Sections such as **Introduction**, **Key Sections**, and **Conclusion** are defined based on the topic.\n",
        "   - A **web search tool** is used to collect information required before deciding the main sections.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Parallel Execution for Research and Writing**:\n",
        "   - The agent uses **parallel execution** to efficiently perform:\n",
        "     - **Web Research**: Queries are generated for each section and executed via the web search tool to retrieve up-to-date information.\n",
        "     - **Section Writing**: The retrieved data is used to write content for each section, with the following process:\n",
        "       - The **Researcher** gathers relevant data from the web.\n",
        "       - The **Section Writer** uses the data to generate structured content for the assigned section.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Formatting Completed Sections**:\n",
        "   - Once all sections are written, they are formatted to ensure consistency and adherence to the report structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Introduction and Conclusion Writing**:\n",
        "   - After the main sections are completed and formatted:\n",
        "     - The **Introduction** and **Conclusion** are written based on the content of the remaining sections (in parallel)\n",
        "     - This process ensures that these sections align with the overall flow and insights of the report.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Final Compilation**:\n",
        "   - All completed sections are compiled together to generate the **final report**.\n",
        "   - The final output is a comprehensive and structured document in the style of wiki docs.\n",

This covers the basics, real examples, and deployment. I wrote it to simplify LangChain\\'s complex docs and help people build stateful AI agents.\\nFebruary 16, 2025\\xa0·\\xa012 min\\xa0·\\xa0Juan Stoppa\\nI keep finding myself going back to the LangChain documentation to figure out how to use LangGraph. While the documentation is comprehensive, it can be overwhelming to navigate, especially when you’re trying to build advanced AI agents.\\nThis guide is my attempt to consolidate the key concepts and practical implementations of LangGraph in one place. Whether you’re building a conversational agent that needs to remember context, a multi-step reasoning agent, or a complex workflow that coordinates multiple AI components, LangGraph provides the framework to make it happen. I created this reference for myself but I hope it helps others who want a more straightforward explanation of how to use LangGraph effectively.\\nWhat is LangGraph?#\\nLangGraph is a framework that brings state machines to Large Language Model (LLM) applications. It’s particularly useful when you need to build complex, stateful applications with LLMs. The framework allows you to structure your application as a graph, where each node represents a specific task or state, and edges represent transitions between states.\\nBasic LangGraph Example#\\nLet’s start with a simple example to understand the core concepts: we are developing a simple agent that collects information and processes it, the actions of collecting and processing information are just fixed actions but they can be replaced with more complex actions.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph\\nfrom typing import TypedDict, Annotated\\nfrom langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\\nfrom langchain_core.runnables.graph import MermaidDrawMethod\\nclass State(TypedDict):\\n    messages: Annotated[list[str], add_messages]\\n    current_step: str\\ndef collect_info(state: State) -> dict:\\n    print(\"\\\\n--> In collect_info\")\\n    print(f\"Messages before: {state[\\'messages\\']}\")\\nmessages = state[\"messages\"] + [\"Information collected\"]\\nprint(f\"Messages after: {messages}\")\\n\\nreturn {\\n    \"messages\": messages,\\n    \"current_step\": \"process\"\\n}\\n\\ndef process_info(state: State) -> dict:\\n    print(\"\\\\n--> In process_info\")\\n    print(f\"Messages before: {state[\\'messages\\']}\")\\nmessages = state[\"messages\"] + [\"Information processed\"]\\nprint(f\"Messages after: {messages}\")\\n\\nreturn {\\n    \"messages\": messages,\\n    \"current_step\": \"end\"\\n}\\n\\nCreate and setup graph\\nworkflow = StateGraph(State)\\nAdd nodes\\nworkflow.add_node(\"collect\", collect_info)\\nworkflow.add_node(\"process\", process_info)\\nAdd edges\\nworkflow.add_edge(\"collect\", \"process\")\\nSet entry and finish points\\nworkflow.set_entry_point(\"collect\")\\nworkflow.set_finish_point(\"process\")\\napp = workflow.compile()\\nRun workflow\\nprint(\"\\\\nStarting workflow...\")\\ninitial_state = State(messages=[\"Starting\"], current_step=\"collect\")\\nfinal_state = app.invoke(initial_state)\\nprint(f\"\\\\nFinal messages: {final_state[\\'messages\\']}\")\\nSave the graph visualization as PNG\\npng_data = app.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png(draw_method=MermaidDrawMethod.API)\\nwith open(\"workflow_graph.png\", \"wb\") as f:\\n    f.write(png_data)\\nprint(\"\\\\nGraph visualization saved as \\'workflow_graph.png\\'\")\\n```\\nThis example shows the basic structure of a LangGraph application:\\n\\nDefine your state using TypedDict, it contains the information that the workflow will need to keep track of.\\nCreate functions for each state, these functions are the actions that the workflow will perform.\\nBuild a graph with nodes and edges, the nodes are the states and the edges are the transitions between them.\\nCompile the graph into a runnable application, this will create a callable object that can be invoked with an initial state.\\nI also added a simple way to save the graph visualization as a PNG file, this will work if you are running this example locally and should save a file that will show the graph structure like below.\\n\\nThe graph is a good way to understand the workflow, it shows the nodes and the edges between them, the entry and finish points and the state of the workflow.\\n\\nThis particular example is not very useful but it shows the core concepts of LangGraph, you can simply replace the fixed actions with more complex ones and build a useful agent.\\nServing LangGraph as a Web Service#\\nWhile LangGraph itself doesn’t include built-in server capabilities, you can easily create a web service using FastAPI to serve your LangGraph workflows. Below I have modified the previous example to add a simple FastAPI server that allows you to run the workflow from a web interface.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph\\nfrom typing import TypedDict, Annotated, List\\nfrom langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\\nInitialize FastAPI app\\napp = FastAPI(title=\"LangGraph Agent API\")\\nclass State(TypedDict):\\n    messages: Annotated[list[str], add_messages]\\n    current_step: str\\nclass AgentInput(BaseModel):\\n    messages: List[str]\\ndef collect_info(state: State) -> dict:\\n    print(\"\\\\n--> In collect_info\")\\n    print(f\"Messages before: {state[\\'messages\\']}\")\\nmessages = state[\"messages\"] + [\"Information collected\"]\\nprint(f\"Messages after: {messages}\")\\n\\nreturn {\\n    \"messages\": messages,\\n    \"current_step\": \"process\"\\n}\\n\\ndef process_info(state: State) -> dict:\\n    print(\"\\\\n--> In process_info\")\\n    print(f\"Messages before: {state[\\'messages\\']}\")\\nmessages = state[\"messages\"] + [\"Information processed\"]\\nprint(f\"Messages after: {messages}\")\\n\\nreturn {\\n    \"messages\": messages,\\n    \"current_step\": \"end\"\\n}\\n\\nCreate and setup graph\\nworkflow = StateGraph(State)\\nAdd nodes\\nworkflow.add_node(\"collect\", collect_info)\\nworkflow.add_node(\"process\", process_info)\\nAdd edges\\nworkflow.add_edge(\"collect\", \"process\")\\nSet entry and finish points\\nworkflow.set_entry_point(\"collect\")\\nworkflow.set_finish_point(\"process\")\\nCompile the workflow\\nagent = workflow.compile()\\n@app.post(\"/run-agent\")\\nasync def run_agent(input_data: AgentInput):\\n    \"\"\"\\n    Run the agent with the provided input messages.\\n    \"\"\"\\n    initial_state = State(messages=input_data.messages, current_step=\"collect\")\\n    final_state = agent.invoke(initial_state)\\n    return {\"messages\": final_state[\"messages\"]}\\n@app.get(\"/\")\\nasync def root():\\n    \"\"\"\\n    Root endpoint that returns basic API information.\\n    \"\"\"\\n    return {\"message\": \"LangGraph Agent API is running\", \"endpoints\": [\"Navigate to https://jstoppa-langgraph-basic-example-api.hf.space/docs#/default/run_agent_run_agent_post to run the example\"]}\\nif name == \"main\":\\n    import uvicorn\\n    uvicorn.run(app, host=\"0.0.0.0\", port=7860)\\n```\\nYou can run this locally or using the Hugging Face space below, this is the URL to access the swagger API for this example https://jstoppa-langgraph-basic-example-api.hf.space/docs, the API has an end point to run the agent and it returns the messages we’ve seen in our previous example (see below the results). In simple words, the API has an end point to run the agent and it returns the messages we’ve seen in our previous example.\\n\\nMaking it all work with a more interesting example#\\nWe are now going to create a more interesting example, an AI agent that does code reviews, this is far from a production-ready agent but it will give us a better understanding of how to use LangGraph.\\nThe screenshot below shows the interface for the code review agent, the user can enter a code and the agent will return a report with the code analysis. This interface uses the Gradio library to create a simple web interface, this saves a lot of time compared to building a full web app.\\n\\nThe full code is provided after this but the most impportant part of the example is the graph, it shows the nodes and the edges between them, the entry and finish points and the state of the workflow, this is how the graph will look through the code and analyse the code with different agents that are especialised on different aspects. This is a very similar apporach we’ve seen in the previous example but it contains more actions and the actions do use LLMs to analyse the code.\\n```python\\nCreate and setup graph\\nworkflow = StateGraph(State)\\nAdd nodes\\nworkflow.add_node(\"style\", analyze_code_style)\\nworkflow.add_node(\"security\", analyze_security)\\nworkflow.add_node(\"performance\", analyze_performance)\\nworkflow.add_node(\"architecture\", analyze_architecture)\\nworkflow.add_node(\"recommendations\", generate_final_recommendations)\\nAdd edges\\nworkflow.add_edge(\"style\", \"security\")\\nworkflow.add_edge(\"security\", \"performance\")\\nworkflow.add_edge(\"performance\", \"architecture\")\\nworkflow.add_edge(\"architecture\", \"recommendations\")\\nSet entry and finish points\\nworkflow.set_entry_point(\"style\")\\nworkflow.set_finish_point(\"recommendations\")\\nCompile the workflow\\nagent = workflow.compile()\\n```\\nthe full code for the agent is below and it can also be found in Hugging Face below. \\n```python\\nimport gradio as gr\\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph\\nfrom typing import TypedDict, Annotated, List, Dict\\nfrom langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\\nfrom langchain_core.messages import SystemMessage, HumanMessage, AIMessage\\nimport json\\nimport requests\\nimport os\\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\\nimport time\\nLoad environment variables\\nload_dotenv()\\nDefine the state structure\\nclass State(TypedDict):\\n    messages: Annotated[list[SystemMessage | HumanMessage | AIMessage], add_messages]\\n    current_step: str\\n    code: str\\n    style_analysis: Dict\\n    security_analysis: Dict\\n    performance_analysis: Dict\\n    architecture_analysis: Dict\\n    final_recommendations: Dict\\ndef call_huggingface_api(prompt: str, max_retries=3) -> Dict:\\n    \"\"\"Call Hugging Face API with retry logic and proper error handling.\"\"\"\\n    api_key = os.getenv(\"HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY\")\\n    if not api_key:\\n        raise ValueError(\"HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY not found in environment variables\")\\n# You can change this to any model you prefer\\nAPI_URL = \"https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1\"\\nheaders = {\"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {api_key}\"}\\n\\nfor attempt in range(max_retries):\\n    try:\\n        response = requests.post(\\n            API_URL,\\n            headers=headers,\\n            json={\\n                \"inputs\": prompt,\\n                \"parameters\": {\\n                    \"max_new_tokens\": 1000,\\n                    \"temperature\": 0.7,\\n                    \"top_p\": 0.95,\\n                    \"return_full_text\": False\\n                }\\n            }\\n        )\\n\\n        if response.status_code == 200:\\n            result = response.json()\\n            if isinstance(result, list) and len(result) > 0:\\n                # Extract the generated text\\n                text = result[0].get(\\'generated_text\\', \\'\\')\\n                # Try to parse as JSON if it contains JSON\\n                try:\\n                    # Find JSON content between triple backticks if present\\n                    if \"```json\" in text:\\n                        json_str = text.split(\"```json\")[1].split(\"```\")[0].strip()\\n                    else:\\n                        json_str = text.strip()\\n                    return json.loads(json_str)\\n                except json.JSONDecodeError:\\n                    return {\"error\": \"Failed to parse JSON from response\", \"raw_text\": text}\\n\\n        # If model is loading, wait and retry\\n        if response.status_code == 503:\\n            wait_time = 2 ** attempt\\n            time.sleep(wait_time)\\n            continue\\n\\n    except Exception as e:\\n        if attempt == max_retries - 1:\\n            return {\"error\": f\"API call failed: {str(e)}\"}\\n        time.sleep(2 ** attempt)\\n\\nreturn {\"error\": \"Maximum retries reached\"}\\n\\ndef analyze_code_style(state: State) -> dict:\\n    \"\"\"Analyze code style and best practices.\"\"\"\\n    code = state[\"code\"]\\n    prompt = f\"\"\"You are a senior code reviewer focused on code style and best practices.

manage complex workflows. The graph-based approach keeps things organised and flexible, especially when dealing with multi-step processes or memory.\\nEven though LangGraph doesn’t come with built-in server features, it works well with FastAPI and other frameworks to serve agents as APIs. Whether you’re building a chatbot, a code reviewer, or something else entirely, it gives you a solid foundation to work with.\\nI’m still experimenting and learning, so I’ll keep updating this post as I find better ways to use LangGraph.

It ensures the data being passed between nodes follows a consistent format.\\n\\nIn Python terms, a schema can be any data type.\\nHowever, it is typically represented using TypedDict or a Pydantic BaseModel.\\n\\nThe schema helps nodes interpret the state correctly, ensuring smooth execution across the graph.\\n3. Nodes vs. Edges: What’s the Difference?\\nLangGraph can be visualized as a program of programs. It consists of:\\n\\nNodes: Perform the actual work. Nodes contain Python code that can execute any logic, from simple computations to LLM calls or integrations.\\nEdges: Define what happens next. Edges determine the flow of the state between nodes.\\n\\nNodes&Edges: A Messaging App Analogy\\nTo understand the role of edges in LangGraph, let’s use a relatable analogy: a messaging application on our smartphones.\\nIn this metaphor:\\n\\nWe (humans) represent the nodes.\\nThe edges are the connections or chat threads we create to communicate with others.\\n\\nHere’s how this analogy maps to LangGraph:\\n\\nDrawing the Edge:\\n    When we want to communicate with someone, we open the messaging app and select the correct chatbox. This action of choosing the chat creates an edge — it establishes a connection between two nodes (you and the recipient).\\n\\nInteracting Through the App:\\n    Once the connection (edge) is established, we interact with the app in various ways:\\n\\n\\nHolding the mic button to send a voice message.\\n\\nTyping a text message of any length.\\nCapturing and sending a video using the camera feature.\\n\\nEach of these interactions follows a well-structured sequence of events specific to the messaging app. For example:\\n\\nA text message has a specific format (sender, recipient, message content).\\nA voice message includes data like audio duration and file size.\\nA video message involves capturing, compressing, and attaching a media file.\\n\\nThese predefined structures in the messaging app are synonymous with the schema of the state in LangGraph. Just as a messaging app ensures all interactions (messages) follow a consistent format, the schema in LangGraph ensures the state passed along edges is structured and interpretable.\\nLangGraph’s Simplicity:\\nThe key difference lies in complexity. In a messaging app, interactions are event-driven and dynamic (e.g., pressing buttons, recording audio, typing text). However, in LangGraph, the schema of the state is much simpler and defined at static time — meaning it is established before execution rather than evolving during runtime.\\nThis static schema allows nodes to rely on a consistent state format, ensuring seamless communication along edges throughout the graph.\\nSimple Graph for Structured parsing with fallback\\nFollowing illustrations represents a simple and structured parser workflow with an integrated retry mechanism to handle errors during the parsing process.\\nThrough this illustration let’s try to understand modular nature of nodes and relevance of edges in the graph. Each node takes state input and yields updated state as output. Sometimes nodes do nothing to the input state and spits out the same state as output.\\nIf we provide proper input state to each individual nodes, they would provide the expected output. ie They are completely modular code sections on their own. Thus with sufficient interface engineering we can implement any graph built using LangGraph without any framework.\\n\\nGraph without edges connecting nodes\\nFollowing image shows the proper graph structure of the Structured Ouptut Parser with Fallback\\nMajor difference is the directed edges connecting different blocks in a logical fashion. These logical connections themselves become some sort of a program. LangGraph framework provides large verity of methods and mechanism to implement such such graphs while still maintaining the modularity.\\n\\nSame graph with directed edges\\nConclusion\\nIn this article, we explored the foundational concepts of graph-based systems, drawing parallels to familiar messaging applications to illustrate how edges, nodes, and state transitions function seamlessly in dynamic workflows. We then delved into a structured parser graph with an integrated retry mechanism, showcasing how LangGraph-like frameworks manage complex processes efficiently.\\nReference : https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/\\n\\nSign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world.\\nFree\\nDistraction-free reading.

It\\'s exciting, but it comes with challenges: managing the state of various agents, coordinating their interactions, and handling errors effectively. This is where LangGraph can help.\\nLangGraph is a library within the LangChain ecosystem designed to tackle these challenges head-on. LangGraph provides a framework for defining, coordinating, and executing multiple LLM agents (or chains) in a structured manner.\\nIt simplifies the development process by enabling the creation of cyclical graphs, which are essential for developing agent runtimes. With LangGraph, we can easily build robust, scalable, and flexible multi-agent systems.\\nIf you want to learn more about the LangChain ecosystem, I recommend this introduction to LangChain.\\nWhat Is LangGraph?\\nLangGraph enables us to create stateful, multi-actor applications utilizing LLMs as easily as possible. It extends the capabilities of LangChain, introducing the ability to create and manage cyclical graphs, which are pivotal for developing sophisticated agent runtimes. The core concepts of LangGraph include: graph structure, state management, and coordination.\\nGraph structure\\nImagine your application as a directed graph. In LangGraph, each node represents an LLM agent, and the edges are the communication channels between these agents. This structure allows for clear and manageable workflows, where each agent performs specific tasks and passes information to other agents as needed.\\nState management\\nOne of LangGraph\\'s standout features is its automatic state management. This feature enables us to track and persist information across multiple interactions. As agents perform their tasks, the state is dynamically updated, ensuring the system maintains context and responds appropriately to new inputs.\\nCoordination\\nLangGraph ensures agents execute in the correct order and that necessary information is exchanged seamlessly. This coordination is vital for complex applications where multiple agents need to work together to achieve a common goal. By managing the flow of data and the sequence of operations, LangGraph allows developers to focus on the high-level logic of their applications rather than the intricacies of agent coordination.\\nWhy LangGraph?\\nAs I mentioned above, LangGraph offers several significant advantages for developers working with complex LLM applications. Here are some of the real-world benefits LangGraph offers.\\nSimplified development\\nLangGraph abstracts away the complexities associated with state management and agent coordination. This means developers can define their workflows and logic without worrying about the underlying mechanisms that ensure data consistency and proper execution order. This simplification accelerates the development process and reduces the likelihood of errors. It’s a game-changer!\\nFlexibility\\nWith LangGraph, developers have the flexibility to define their own agent logic and communication protocols. This allows for highly customized applications tailored to specific use cases. Whether you need a chatbot that can handle various types of user requests or a multi-agent system that performs complex tasks, LangGraph provides the tools to build exactly what you need. It’s all about giving you the power to create.\\nScalability\\nLangGraph is built to support the execution of large-scale multi-agent applications. Its robust architecture can handle a high volume of interactions and complex workflows, enabling the development of scalable systems that can grow with your needs. This makes it suitable for enterprise-level applications and scenarios where performance and reliability are critical.\\nFault tolerance\\nReliability is a core consideration in the design of LangGraph. The library includes mechanisms for gracefully handling errors, ensuring that your application can continue to operate even when individual agents encounter issues. This fault tolerance is essential for maintaining the stability and robustness of complex multi-agent systems. Peace of mind is just a feature away.\\nGetting Started With LangGraph\\nLet’s see how we can set up LangGraph and what the basic concepts are.\\nInstallation\\nTo install LangGraph, you can use pip:\\npip install -U langgraph\\nPowered By \\nWas this helpful? Yes No\\nBasic Concepts\\nNodes: Nodes represent units of work within your LangGraph. They are typically Python functions that perform a specific task, such as:\\n\\nInteracting with an LLM\\nCalling a tool or API\\nPerforming some data manipulation\\nReceiving user input\\nExecuting business logic\\n\\nIn LangGraph, you can add nodes using the graph.add_node(name, value) syntax.\\nEdges: Edges are communication channels between nodes. They define the flow of information and the order of execution. You can add edges using the graph.add_edge(node1, node2) syntax.\\nState: The state is a central object updated over time by the nodes in the graph. It manages the internal state of your application and can be overridden or added to, depending on the application\\'s requirements. This state can hold things such as:\\n\\nConversation history: A list of messages between the agent and the user.\\nContextual data: Information relevant to the current task or interaction.\\nInternal variables: Flags, counters, or other variables to track the agent\\'s progress and behavior.\\n\\nBuilding a Simple LangGraph Application\\nHere’s a step-by-step example of creating a basic chatbot application using LangGraph.\\nStep 1: Define the StateGraph\\nDefine a StateGraph object to structure the chatbot as a state machine. The State is a class object defined with a single key messages of type List and uses the add_messages() function to append new messages rather than overwrite them.\\nfrom typing import Annotated\\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph\\nfrom langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\\nclass State(TypedDict):\\n    # messages have the type \"list\".\\n    # The add_messages function appends messages to the list, rather than overwriting them\\n    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]\\ngraph_builder = StateGraph(State)\\nPowered By \\nWas this helpful? Yes No\\nStep 2: Initialize an LLM and add it as a Chatbot node\\nHere, we initialize the AzureChatOpenAI model and create a simple chatbot function that takes in the state messages as input and generates a message response (which is subsequently appended to the state).\\nThis chatbot function is added as a node named “chatbot” to the graph.\\n```\\nfrom langchain_openai import AzureChatOpenAI\\nllm = AzureChatOpenAI(\\n    openai_api_version=os.environ[\"AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION\"],\\n    azure_deployment=os.environ[\"AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT_NAME\"],\\n)\\ndef chatbot(state: State):\\n    return {\"messages\": [llm.invoke(state[\"messages\"])]}\\n‘’’The first argument is the unique node name\\nThe second argument is the function or object that will be called whenever the node is used.’’’\\ngraph_builder.add_node(\"chatbot\", chatbot)\\n```\\nPowered By \\nStep 3: Set edges\\nSince we are building a simple chatbot, we set the chatbot node as both the entry and finish points of the graph to indicate where to start and end the process.\\n```\\nSet entry and finish points\\ngraph_builder.set_entry_point(\"chatbot\")\\ngraph_builder.set_finish_point(\"chatbot\")\\n```\\nPowered By \\nWas this helpful? Yes No\\nStep 4: Compile and Visualize the Graph\\nCompile the graph to create a CompiledGraph object, and optionally, we can visualize the graph structure using the code below:\\ngraph = graph_builder.compile()\\nfrom IPython.display import Image, display\\ntry:\\n    display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))\\nexcept Exception:\\n    pass\\nPowered By \\nWas this helpful? Yes No\\n\\nStep 5: Run the chatbot\\nFinally, we implement a loop to continuously prompt the user for input, process it through the graph, and print the assistant\\'s response. The loop exits when the user types \"quit\", \"exit\", or \"q\".\\n```\\nRun the chatbot\\nwhile True:\\n    user_input = input(\"User: \")\\n    if user_input.lower() in [\"quit\", \"exit\", \"q\"]:\\n        print(\"Goodbye!\")\\n        break\\n    for event in graph.stream({\"messages\": [(\"user\", user_input)]}):\\n        for value in event.values():\\n            print(\"Assistant:\", value[\"messages\"][-1].content)\\n```\\nPowered By \\nWas this helpful? Yes No\\nAdvanced LangGraph Features\\nNow that we covered the basics, let’s take a look at some advanced features.\\nCustom node types\\nLangGraph allows you to create custom node types to implement complex agent logic. This provides flexibility and control over your application\\'s behavior.\\nfrom typing import Annotated\\nfrom langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic\\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph\\nfrom langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\\nclass MyCustomNode:\\n    def __init__(self, llm):\\n        self.llm = llm\\n    def __call__(self, state):\\n        # Implement your custom logic here\\n        # Access the state and perform actions\\n        messages = state[\"messages\"]\\n        response = self.llm.invoke(messages)\\n        return {\"messages\": [response]}\\ngraph_builder = StateGraph(State)\\nllm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-haiku-20240307\")\\ncustom_node = MyCustomNode(llm)\\ngraph_builder.add_node(\"custom_node\", custom_node)\\nPowered By \\nWas this helpful? Yes No\\nHere, we define a class MyCustomNode that encapsulates custom logic and interacts with the LLM. This provides a more structured and maintainable way to implement complex node behaviors.\\nEdge types\\nLangGraph supports different edge types to handle various communication patterns between nodes. One useful type is the conditional edge, which allows for decision-making based on a node\\'s output.\\nTo create a conditional edge, you need three components:\\n\\nThe upstream node: The node\\'s output decides the next step.\\nA function: This function evaluates the upstream node\\'s output and determines the next node to execute, returning a string that represents the decision.\\nA mapping: This mapping links the possible outcomes of the function to the corresponding nodes to be executed.\\n\\nHere\\'s an example in pseudocode:\\ngraph.add_conditional_edge(\\n    \"model\",\\n    should_continue,\\n    {\\n        \"end\": END,\\n        \"continue\": \"tools\"\\n    }\\n)\\nPowered By \\nWas this helpful? Yes No\\nHere, after the “model” node is called, we can either exit the graph (”end”) and return to the user, or we can continue (”continue”) and call a tool—depending on what the user decides!\\nState management\\nLangGraph offers powerful state management techniques, which include using external databases like SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, or cloud storage solutions like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage to store and retrieve your agent\\'s state, enabling reliability and scalability.\\nHere\\'s an example of using a SQLite database for state management:\\n```\\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.sqlite import SqliteSaver\\nConnect to the SQLite database\\nmemory = SqliteSaver.from_conn_string(\":memory:\")\\nCompile the graph with the checkpointer\\ngraph = graph_builder.compile(checkpointer=memory)\\n```\\nPowered By \\nWas this helpful? Yes No\\nError handling\\nLangGraph also provides mechanisms for error handling:\\n\\nExceptions: Node functions can raise exceptions to signal errors during execution. You can catch and handle these exceptions to prevent your graph from crashing.\\nRetry mechanisms: You can implement retry logic within your nodes to handle transient errors, such as network issues or API timeouts.\\nLogging: Use logging to record errors and track the execution of your graph.\\n\\nReal-World Applications of LangGraph\\nLangGraph can be used to build a wide range of applications.\\nChatbots\\nLangGraph is ideal for developing sophisticated chatbots that can handle a wide array of user requests. By leveraging multiple LLM agents, these chatbots can process natural language queries, provide accurate responses, and seamlessly switch between different conversation topics. The ability to manage state and coordinate interactions ensures that the chatbot maintains context and delivers a coherent user experience.\\nAutonomous agents\\nFor applications requiring autonomous decision-making, LangGraph enables the creation of agents that can perform tasks independently based on user inputs and predefined logic.\\nThese agents can execute complex workflows, interact with other systems, and adapt to new information dynamically. LangGraph\\'s structured framework ensures that each agent operates efficiently and effectively, making it suitable for tasks like automated customer support, data processing, and system monitoring.\\nMulti-Agent systems\\nLangGraph excels in building applications where multiple agents collaborate to achieve a common goal. For example, different agents can manage inventory, process orders, and coordinate deliveries in a supply chain management system. LangGraph\\'s coordination capabilities ensure that each agent communicates effectively, sharing information and making decisions in a synchronized manner. This leads to more efficient operations and better overall system performance.\\nWorkflow automation tools\\nWith LangGraph, automating business processes and workflows becomes straightforward. Intelligent agents can be designed to handle tasks such as document processing, approval workflows, and data analysis. By defining clear workflows and leveraging LangGraph\\'s state management, these tools can execute complex sequences of actions without human intervention, reducing errors and increasing productivity.\\nRecommendation systems\\nPersonalized recommendation systems can greatly benefit from LangGraph\\'s capabilities. By employing multiple agents to analyze user behavior, preferences, and contextual data, these systems can deliver tailored suggestions for products, content, or services. LangGraph\\'s flexibility allows for integrating various data sources and algorithms, enhancing the accuracy and relevance of recommendations.\\nPersonalized learning environments\\nIn educational platforms, LangGraph can be used to create adaptive learning environments that cater to individual learning styles and needs. Multiple agents can assess a student\\'s progress, provide customized exercises, and offer real-time feedback.

This covers the basics, real examples, and deployment. I wrote it to simplify LangChain\\'s complex docs and help people build stateful AI agents.\\nFebruary 16, 2025\\xa0·\\xa012 min\\xa0·\\xa0Juan Stoppa\\nI keep finding myself going back to the LangChain documentation to figure out how to use LangGraph. While the documentation is comprehensive, it can be overwhelming to navigate, especially when you’re trying to build advanced AI agents.\\nThis guide is my attempt to consolidate the key concepts and practical implementations of LangGraph in one place. Whether you’re building a conversational agent that needs to remember context, a multi-step reasoning agent, or a complex workflow that coordinates multiple AI components, LangGraph provides the framework to make it happen. I created this reference for myself but I hope it helps others who want a more straightforward explanation of how to use LangGraph effectively.\\nWhat is LangGraph?#\\nLangGraph is a framework that brings state machines to Large Language Model (LLM) applications. It’s particularly useful when you need to build complex, stateful applications with LLMs. The framework allows you to structure your application as a graph, where each node represents a specific task or state, and edges represent transitions between states.\\nBasic LangGraph Example#\\nLet’s start with a simple example to understand the core concepts: we are developing a simple agent that collects information and processes it, the actions of collecting and processing information are just fixed actions but they can be replaced with more complex actions.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph\\nfrom typing import TypedDict, Annotated\\nfrom langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\\nfrom langchain_core.runnables.graph import MermaidDrawMethod\\nclass State(TypedDict):\\n    messages: Annotated[list[str], add_messages]\\n    current_step: str\\ndef collect_info(state: State) -> dict:\\n    print(\"\\\\n--> In collect_info\")\\n    print(f\"Messages before: {state[\\'messages\\']}\")\\nmessages = state[\"messages\"] + [\"Information collected\"]\\nprint(f\"Messages after: {messages}\")\\n\\nreturn {\\n    \"messages\": messages,\\n    \"current_step\": \"process\"\\n}\\n\\ndef process_info(state: State) -> dict:\\n    print(\"\\\\n--> In process_info\")\\n    print(f\"Messages before: {state[\\'messages\\']}\")\\nmessages = state[\"messages\"] + [\"Information processed\"]\\nprint(f\"Messages after: {messages}\")\\n\\nreturn {\\n    \"messages\": messages,\\n    \"current_step\": \"end\"\\n}\\n\\nCreate and setup graph\\nworkflow = StateGraph(State)\\nAdd nodes\\nworkflow.add_node(\"collect\", collect_info)\\nworkflow.add_node(\"process\", process_info)\\nAdd edges\\nworkflow.add_edge(\"collect\", \"process\")\\nSet entry and finish points\\nworkflow.set_entry_point(\"collect\")\\nworkflow.set_finish_point(\"process\")\\napp = workflow.compile()\\nRun workflow\\nprint(\"\\\\nStarting workflow...\")\\ninitial_state = State(messages=[\"Starting\"], current_step=\"collect\")\\nfinal_state = app.invoke(initial_state)\\nprint(f\"\\\\nFinal messages: {final_state[\\'messages\\']}\")\\nSave the graph visualization as PNG\\npng_data = app.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png(draw_method=MermaidDrawMethod.API)\\nwith open(\"workflow_graph.png\", \"wb\") as f:\\n    f.write(png_data)\\nprint(\"\\\\nGraph visualization saved as \\'workflow_graph.png\\'\")\\n```\\nThis example shows the basic structure of a LangGraph application:\\n\\nDefine your state using TypedDict, it contains the information that the workflow will need to keep track of.\\nCreate functions for each state, these functions are the actions that the workflow will perform.\\nBuild a graph with nodes and edges, the nodes are the states and the edges are the transitions between them.\\nCompile the graph into a runnable application, this will create a callable object that can be invoked with an initial state.\\nI also added a simple way to save the graph visualization as a PNG file, this will work if you are running this example locally and should save a file that will show the graph structure like below.\\n\\nThe graph is a good way to understand the workflow, it shows the nodes and the edges between them, the entry and finish points and the state of the workflow.\\n\\nThis particular example is not very useful but it shows the core concepts of LangGraph, you can simply replace the fixed actions with more complex ones and build a useful agent.\\nServing LangGraph as a Web Service#\\nWhile LangGraph itself doesn’t include built-in server capabilities, you can easily create a web service using FastAPI to serve your LangGraph workflows. Below I have modified the previous example to add a simple FastAPI server that allows you to run the workflow from a web interface.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph\\nfrom typing import TypedDict, Annotated, List\\nfrom langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\\nInitialize FastAPI app\\napp = FastAPI(title=\"LangGraph Agent API\")\\nclass State(TypedDict):\\n    messages: Annotated[list[str], add_messages]\\n    current_step: str\\nclass AgentInput(BaseModel):\\n    messages: List[str]\\ndef collect_info(state: State) -> dict:\\n    print(\"\\\\n--> In collect_info\")\\n    print(f\"Messages before: {state[\\'messages\\']}\")\\nmessages = state[\"messages\"] + [\"Information collected\"]\\nprint(f\"Messages after: {messages}\")\\n\\nreturn {\\n    \"messages\": messages,\\n    \"current_step\": \"process\"\\n}\\n\\ndef process_info(state: State) -> dict:\\n    print(\"\\\\n--> In process_info\")\\n    print(f\"Messages before: {state[\\'messages\\']}\")\\nmessages = state[\"messages\"] + [\"Information processed\"]\\nprint(f\"Messages after: {messages}\")\\n\\nreturn {\\n    \"messages\": messages,\\n    \"current_step\": \"end\"\\n}\\n\\nCreate and setup graph\\nworkflow = StateGraph(State)\\nAdd nodes\\nworkflow.add_node(\"collect\", collect_info)\\nworkflow.add_node(\"process\", process_info)\\nAdd edges\\nworkflow.add_edge(\"collect\", \"process\")\\nSet entry and finish points\\nworkflow.set_entry_point(\"collect\")\\nworkflow.set_finish_point(\"process\")\\nCompile the workflow\\nagent = workflow.compile()\\n@app.post(\"/run-agent\")\\nasync def run_agent(input_data: AgentInput):\\n    \"\"\"\\n    Run the agent with the provided input messages.\\n    \"\"\"\\n    initial_state = State(messages=input_data.messages, current_step=\"collect\")\\n    final_state = agent.invoke(initial_state)\\n    return {\"messages\": final_state[\"messages\"]}\\n@app.get(\"/\")\\nasync def root():\\n    \"\"\"\\n    Root endpoint that returns basic API information.\\n    \"\"\"\\n    return {\"message\": \"LangGraph Agent API is running\", \"endpoints\": [\"Navigate to https://jstoppa-langgraph-basic-example-api.hf.space/docs#/default/run_agent_run_agent_post to run the example\"]}\\nif name == \"main\":\\n    import uvicorn\\n    uvicorn.run(app, host=\"0.0.0.0\", port=7860)\\n```\\nYou can run this locally or using the Hugging Face space below, this is the URL to access the swagger API for this example https://jstoppa-langgraph-basic-example-api.hf.space/docs, the API has an end point to run the agent and it returns the messages we’ve seen in our previous example (see below the results). In simple words, the API has an end point to run the agent and it returns the messages we’ve seen in our previous example.\\n\\nMaking it all work with a more interesting example#\\nWe are now going to create a more interesting example, an AI agent that does code reviews, this is far from a production-ready agent but it will give us a better understanding of how to use LangGraph.\\nThe screenshot below shows the interface for the code review agent, the user can enter a code and the agent will return a report with the code analysis. This interface uses the Gradio library to create a simple web interface, this saves a lot of time compared to building a full web app.\\n\\nThe full code is provided after this but the most impportant part of the example is the graph, it shows the nodes and the edges between them, the entry and finish points and the state of the workflow, this is how the graph will look through the code and analyse the code with different agents that are especialised on different aspects.

It ensures the data being passed between nodes follows a consistent format.\\n\\nIn Python terms, a schema can be any data type.\\nHowever, it is typically represented using TypedDict or a Pydantic BaseModel.\\n\\nThe schema helps nodes interpret the state correctly, ensuring smooth execution across the graph.\\n3. Nodes vs. Edges: What’s the Difference?\\nLangGraph can be visualized as a program of programs. It consists of:\\n\\nNodes: Perform the actual work. Nodes contain Python code that can execute any logic, from simple computations to LLM calls or integrations.\\nEdges: Define what happens next. Edges determine the flow of the state between nodes.\\n\\nNodes&Edges: A Messaging App Analogy\\nTo understand the role of edges in LangGraph, let’s use a relatable analogy: a messaging application on our smartphones.\\nIn this metaphor:\\n\\nWe (humans) represent the nodes.\\nThe edges are the connections or chat threads we create to communicate with others.\\n\\nHere’s how this analogy maps to LangGraph:\\n\\nDrawing the Edge:\\n    When we want to communicate with someone, we open the messaging app and select the correct chatbox. This action of choosing the chat creates an edge — it establishes a connection between two nodes (you and the recipient).\\n\\nInteracting Through the App:\\n    Once the connection (edge) is established, we interact with the app in various ways:\\n\\n\\nHolding the mic button to send a voice message.\\n\\nTyping a text message of any length.\\nCapturing and sending a video using the camera feature.\\n\\nEach of these interactions follows a well-structured sequence of events specific to the messaging app. For example:\\n\\nA text message has a specific format (sender, recipient, message content).\\nA voice message includes data like audio duration and file size.\\nA video message involves capturing, compressing, and attaching a media file.\\n\\nThese predefined structures in the messaging app are synonymous with the schema of the state in LangGraph. Just as a messaging app ensures all interactions (messages) follow a consistent format, the schema in LangGraph ensures the state passed along edges is structured and interpretable.\\nLangGraph’s Simplicity:\\nThe key difference lies in complexity. In a messaging app, interactions are event-driven and dynamic (e.g., pressing buttons, recording audio, typing text). However, in LangGraph, the schema of the state is much simpler and defined at static time — meaning it is established before execution rather than evolving during runtime.\\nThis static schema allows nodes to rely on a consistent state format, ensuring seamless communication along edges throughout the graph.\\nSimple Graph for Structured parsing with fallback\\nFollowing illustrations represents a simple and structured parser workflow with an integrated retry mechanism to handle errors during the parsing process.\\nThrough this illustration let’s try to understand modular nature of nodes and relevance of edges in the graph. Each node takes state input and yields updated state as output. Sometimes nodes do nothing to the input state and spits out the same state as output.\\nIf we provide proper input state to each individual nodes, they would provide the expected output. ie They are completely modular code sections on their own. Thus with sufficient interface engineering we can implement any graph built using LangGraph without any framework.\\n\\nGraph without edges connecting nodes\\nFollowing image shows the proper graph structure of the Structured Ouptut Parser with Fallback\\nMajor difference is the directed edges connecting different blocks in a logical fashion. These logical connections themselves become some sort of a program. LangGraph framework provides large verity of methods and mechanism to implement such such graphs while still maintaining the modularity.\\n\\nSame graph with directed edges\\nConclusion\\nIn this article, we explored the foundational concepts of graph-based systems, drawing parallels to familiar messaging applications to illustrate how edges, nodes, and state transitions function seamlessly in dynamic workflows. We then delved into a structured parser graph with an integrated retry mechanism, showcasing how LangGraph-like frameworks manage complex processes efficiently.\\nReference : https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/\\n\\nSign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world.\\nFree\\nDistraction-free reading.

It\\'s exciting, but it comes with challenges: managing the state of various agents, coordinating their interactions, and handling errors effectively. This is where LangGraph can help.\\nLangGraph is a library within the LangChain ecosystem designed to tackle these challenges head-on. LangGraph provides a framework for defining, coordinating, and executing multiple LLM agents (or chains) in a structured manner.\\nIt simplifies the development process by enabling the creation of cyclical graphs, which are essential for developing agent runtimes. With LangGraph, we can easily build robust, scalable, and flexible multi-agent systems.\\nIf you want to learn more about the LangChain ecosystem, I recommend this introduction to LangChain.\\nWhat Is LangGraph?\\nLangGraph enables us to create stateful, multi-actor applications utilizing LLMs as easily as possible. It extends the capabilities of LangChain, introducing the ability to create and manage cyclical graphs, which are pivotal for developing sophisticated agent runtimes. The core concepts of LangGraph include: graph structure, state management, and coordination.\\nGraph structure\\nImagine your application as a directed graph. In LangGraph, each node represents an LLM agent, and the edges are the communication channels between these agents. This structure allows for clear and manageable workflows, where each agent performs specific tasks and passes information to other agents as needed.\\nState management\\nOne of LangGraph\\'s standout features is its automatic state management. This feature enables us to track and persist information across multiple interactions. As agents perform their tasks, the state is dynamically updated, ensuring the system maintains context and responds appropriately to new inputs.\\nCoordination\\nLangGraph ensures agents execute in the correct order and that necessary information is exchanged seamlessly. This coordination is vital for complex applications where multiple agents need to work together to achieve a common goal. By managing the flow of data and the sequence of operations, LangGraph allows developers to focus on the high-level logic of their applications rather than the intricacies of agent coordination.\\nWhy LangGraph?\\nAs I mentioned above, LangGraph offers several significant advantages for developers working with complex LLM applications. Here are some of the real-world benefits LangGraph offers.\\nSimplified development\\nLangGraph abstracts away the complexities associated with state management and agent coordination. This means developers can define their workflows and logic without worrying about the underlying mechanisms that ensure data consistency and proper execution order. This simplification accelerates the development process and reduces the likelihood of errors. It’s a game-changer!\\nFlexibility\\nWith LangGraph, developers have the flexibility to define their own agent logic and communication protocols. This allows for highly customized applications tailored to specific use cases. Whether you need a chatbot that can handle various types of user requests or a multi-agent system that performs complex tasks, LangGraph provides the tools to build exactly what you need. It’s all about giving you the power to create.\\nScalability\\nLangGraph is built to support the execution of large-scale multi-agent applications. Its robust architecture can handle a high volume of interactions and complex workflows, enabling the development of scalable systems that can grow with your needs. This makes it suitable for enterprise-level applications and scenarios where performance and reliability are critical.\\nFault tolerance\\nReliability is a core consideration in the design of LangGraph. The library includes mechanisms for gracefully handling errors, ensuring that your application can continue to operate even when individual agents encounter issues. This fault tolerance is essential for maintaining the stability and robustness of complex multi-agent systems. Peace of mind is just a feature away.\\nGetting Started With LangGraph\\nLet’s see how we can set up LangGraph and what the basic concepts are.\\nInstallation\\nTo install LangGraph, you can use pip:\\npip install -U langgraph\\nPowered By \\nWas this helpful? Yes No\\nBasic Concepts\\nNodes: Nodes represent units of work within your LangGraph. They are typically Python functions that perform a specific task, such as:\\n\\nInteracting with an LLM\\nCalling a tool or API\\nPerforming some data manipulation\\nReceiving user input\\nExecuting business logic\\n\\nIn LangGraph, you can add nodes using the graph.add_node(name, value) syntax.\\nEdges: Edges are communication channels between nodes. They define the flow of information and the order of execution. You can add edges using the graph.add_edge(node1, node2) syntax.\\nState: The state is a central object updated over time by the nodes in the graph. It manages the internal state of your application and can be overridden or added to, depending on the application\\'s requirements. This state can hold things such as:\\n\\nConversation history: A list of messages between the agent and the user.\\nContextual data: Information relevant to the current task or interaction.\\nInternal variables: Flags, counters, or other variables to track the agent\\'s progress and behavior.\\n\\nBuilding a Simple LangGraph Application\\nHere’s a step-by-step example of creating a basic chatbot application using LangGraph.\\nStep 1: Define the StateGraph\\nDefine a StateGraph object to structure the chatbot as a state machine. The State is a class object defined with a single key messages of type List and uses the add_messages() function to append new messages rather than overwrite them.\\nfrom typing import Annotated\\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph\\nfrom langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\\nclass State(TypedDict):\\n    # messages have the type \"list\".\\n    # The add_messages function appends messages to the list, rather than overwriting them\\n    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]\\ngraph_builder = StateGraph(State)\\nPowered By \\nWas this helpful? Yes No\\nStep 2: Initialize an LLM and add it as a Chatbot node\\nHere, we initialize the AzureChatOpenAI model and create a simple chatbot function that takes in the state messages as input and generates a message response (which is subsequently appended to the state).\\nThis chatbot function is added as a node named “chatbot” to the graph.\\n```\\nfrom langchain_openai import AzureChatOpenAI\\nllm = AzureChatOpenAI(\\n    openai_api_version=os.environ[\"AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION\"],\\n    azure_deployment=os.environ[\"AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT_NAME\"],\\n)\\ndef chatbot(state: State):\\n    return {\"messages\": [llm.invoke(state[\"messages\"])]}\\n‘’’The first argument is the unique node name\\nThe second argument is the function or object that will be called whenever the node is used.’’’\\ngraph_builder.add_node(\"chatbot\", chatbot)\\n```\\nPowered By \\nStep 3: Set edges\\nSince we are building a simple chatbot, we set the chatbot node as both the entry and finish points of the graph to indicate where to start and end the process.\\n```\\nSet entry and finish points\\ngraph_builder.set_entry_point(\"chatbot\")\\ngraph_builder.set_finish_point(\"chatbot\")\\n```\\nPowered By \\nWas this helpful? Yes No\\nStep 4: Compile and Visualize the Graph\\nCompile the graph to create a CompiledGraph object, and optionally, we can visualize the graph structure using the code below:\\ngraph = graph_builder.compile()\\nfrom IPython.display import Image, display\\ntry:\\n    display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))\\nexcept Exception:\\n    pass\\nPowered By \\nWas this helpful? Yes No\\n\\nStep 5: Run the chatbot\\nFinally, we implement a loop to continuously prompt the user for input, process it through the graph, and print the assistant\\'s response. The loop exits when the user types \"quit\", \"exit\", or \"q\".\\n```\\nRun the chatbot\\nwhile True:\\n    user_input = input(\"User: \")\\n    if user_input.lower() in [\"quit\", \"exit\", \"q\"]:\\n        print(\"Goodbye!\")\\n        break\\n    for event in graph.stream({\"messages\": [(\"user\", user_input)]}):\\n        for value in event.values():\\n            print(\"Assistant:\", value[\"messages\"][-1].content)\\n```\\nPowered By \\nWas this helpful? Yes No\\nAdvanced LangGraph Features\\nNow that we covered the basics, let’s take a look at some advanced features.\\nCustom node types\\nLangGraph allows you to create custom node types to implement complex agent logic. This provides flexibility and control over your application\\'s behavior.\\nfrom typing import Annotated\\nfrom langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic\\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph\\nfrom langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\\nclass MyCustomNode:\\n    def __init__(self, llm):\\n        self.llm = llm\\n    def __call__(self, state):\\n        # Implement your custom logic here\\n        # Access the state and perform actions\\n        messages = state[\"messages\"]\\n        response = self.llm.invoke(messages)\\n        return {\"messages\": [response]}\\ngraph_builder = StateGraph(State)\\nllm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-haiku-20240307\")\\ncustom_node = MyCustomNode(llm)\\ngraph_builder.add_node(\"custom_node\", custom_node)\\nPowered By \\nWas this helpful? Yes No\\nHere, we define a class MyCustomNode that encapsulates custom logic and interacts with the LLM. This provides a more structured and maintainable way to implement complex node behaviors.\\nEdge types\\nLangGraph supports different edge types to handle various communication patterns between nodes. One useful type is the conditional edge, which allows for decision-making based on a node\\'s output.\\nTo create a conditional edge, you need three components:\\n\\nThe upstream node: The node\\'s output decides the next step.\\nA function: This function evaluates the upstream node\\'s output and determines the next node to execute, returning a string that represents the decision.\\nA mapping: This mapping links the possible outcomes of the function to the corresponding nodes to be executed.\\n\\nHere\\'s an example in pseudocode:\\ngraph.add_conditional_edge(\\n    \"model\",\\n    should_continue,\\n    {\\n        \"end\": END,\\n        \"continue\": \"tools\"\\n    }\\n)\\nPowered By \\nWas this helpful? Yes No\\nHere, after the “model” node is called, we can either exit the graph (”end”) and return to the user, or we can continue (”continue”) and call a tool—depending on what the user decides!\\nState management\\nLangGraph offers powerful state management techniques, which include using external databases like SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, or cloud storage solutions like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage to store and retrieve your agent\\'s state, enabling reliability and scalability.\\nHere\\'s an example of using a SQLite database for state management:\\n```\\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.sqlite import SqliteSaver\\nConnect to the SQLite database\\nmemory = SqliteSaver.from_conn_string(\":memory:\")\\nCompile the graph with the checkpointer\\ngraph = graph_builder.compile(checkpointer=memory)\\n```\\nPowered By \\nWas this helpful? Yes No\\nError handling\\nLangGraph also provides mechanisms for error handling:\\n\\nExceptions: Node functions can raise exceptions to signal errors during execution. You can catch and handle these exceptions to prevent your graph from crashing.\\nRetry mechanisms: You can implement retry logic within your nodes to handle transient errors, such as network issues or API timeouts.\\nLogging: Use logging to record errors and track the execution of your graph.\\n\\nReal-World Applications of LangGraph\\nLangGraph can be used to build a wide range of applications.\\nChatbots\\nLangGraph is ideal for developing sophisticated chatbots that can handle a wide array of user requests. By leveraging multiple LLM agents, these chatbots can process natural language queries, provide accurate responses, and seamlessly switch between different conversation topics. The ability to manage state and coordinate interactions ensures that the chatbot maintains context and delivers a coherent user experience.\\nAutonomous agents\\nFor applications requiring autonomous decision-making, LangGraph enables the creation of agents that can perform tasks independently based on user inputs and predefined logic.\\nThese agents can execute complex workflows, interact with other systems, and adapt to new information dynamically. LangGraph\\'s structured framework ensures that each agent operates efficiently and effectively, making it suitable for tasks like automated customer support, data processing, and system monitoring.\\nMulti-Agent systems\\nLangGraph excels in building applications where multiple agents collaborate to achieve a common goal. For example, different agents can manage inventory, process orders, and coordinate deliveries in a supply chain management system. LangGraph\\'s coordination capabilities ensure that each agent communicates effectively, sharing information and making decisions in a synchronized manner. This leads to more efficient operations and better overall system performance.\\nWorkflow automation tools\\nWith LangGraph, automating business processes and workflows becomes straightforward. Intelligent agents can be designed to handle tasks such as document processing, approval workflows, and data analysis. By defining clear workflows and leveraging LangGraph\\'s state management, these tools can execute complex sequences of actions without human intervention, reducing errors and increasing productivity.\\nRecommendation systems\\nPersonalized recommendation systems can greatly benefit from LangGraph\\'s capabilities. By employing multiple agents to analyze user behavior, preferences, and contextual data, these systems can deliver tailored suggestions for products, content, or services. LangGraph\\'s flexibility allows for integrating various data sources and algorithms, enhancing the accuracy and relevance of recommendations.\\nPersonalized learning environments\\nIn educational platforms, LangGraph can be used to create adaptive learning environments that cater to individual learning styles and needs. Multiple agents can assess a student\\'s progress, provide customized exercises, and offer real-time feedback. The stateful nature of LangGraph ensures that the system retains information about each learner\\'s performance and preferences, enabling a more personalized and effective educational experience.\\nConclusion\\nLangGraph significantly simplifies the development of complex LLM applications by providing a structured framework for managing state and coordinating agent interactions.\\nPotential developments for LangGraph include integration with other LangChain components, support for new LLM models, and the introduction of more advanced agent runtimes from academia.\\nIf you want to learn more about developing applications within the LangChain ecosystem, I recommend this course on developing LLM applications with LangChain.\\n\\n\\nAuthor\\nRyan Ong\\n\\nRyan is a lead data scientist specialising in building AI applications using LLMs. He is a PhD candidate in Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Graphs at Imperial College London, where he also completed his Master’s degree in Computer Science.

        "- Use technical terminology precisely\n",

        "- Strict 150-200 word limit\n",
        "- No marketing language\n",
        "- Technical focus\n",
        "- Write in simple, clear language do not use complex words unnecessarily\n",

        "- Use short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)\n",

        "  * Either a focused table comparing 2-3 key items (using Markdown table syntax)\n",
        "  * Or a short list (3-5 items) using proper Markdown list syntax:\n",

        "  * Format: `- Title : URL`\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Writing Approach:\n",
        "- Include at least one specific example or case study if available\n",
        "- Use concrete details over general statements\n",
        "- Make every word count\n",
        "- No preamble prior to creating the section content\n",
        "- Focus on your single most important point\n",

        "- No preamble prior to creating the section content\n",
